# pHOServer - Simple and Lite Dev HTTP Server

## Overview
Simple and lite Dev HTTP server made with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) that doesn't require any configuration.

Ideal to test or show (make a demonstration) of a static Web project.


## Usage
Just run `pHOServer.js` with **node.js** (`$ node pHOServer.js 8000`) in the current directory where you have your main HTML files (such as `index.html`).

*Please note that it is just a very simple HTTP-Server for development usage only and cannot be for production usage.*


## History

Historically, I made this very simple HTTP server in the goal to show a demonstration of a HTML5 Phaser game.


## Requirement

**Node.js** install (version 6 would be the best..)
